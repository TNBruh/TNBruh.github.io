Post-graduation made me want to try something new. So I decided to try networking based on my friend's suggestion. I got CCNA and signed up for this job. The tasks were mostly monitoring and doing requests related to the data center. I couldn't help but feel that there's a lot that could be automated, so I at least made some scripts to automate some repetitive tasks, such as logging the show command every week.
