### Software Engineer Intern

- Created a blog and knowledge base using WordPress.
- Assisted in testing applications.
- Participated in refactoring the code base.

One of the requirements to graduate is to work, at least do an internship. I was assigned as Software Engineer Intern at this company. On some days, I fix small bugs. I mostly helped test softwares. The one project I was trusted with is to build a knowledge base with WordPress. Never used it before, so naturally, I learnt as I implement it by myself. I tried my best to keep it clean as well.
