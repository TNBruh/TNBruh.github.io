### Information Security Intern

- Performed penetration testing against the main website mainly with Burpsuite and Gobuster.
- Checked potentially open and vulnerable ports with Nmap.
- Performed mobile penetration testing against a mobile app.

I got less busy with university, so I went back to job-hunting. Originally, I signed up as a Backend Developer for the company. But their policy won't allow a student to work full time. So I agreed to be an intern and they let me be an information security intern. This was when my infosec "arc" began. On work, I do the bi-weekly web application pentest against the main site. Occasionally, I was given other things to do, such as testing whether an open port is vulnerable or not. In my free time, usually I'd get an itch to explore more; which made me spend a bit of time practicing in HackTheBox and make PoC malwares.
