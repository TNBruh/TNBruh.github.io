I did much more than just programming. I was given the right and responsibility to not only program the backend, but to also design a multiple sides of the project. The project structure, the API used for the frontend, how the data is structured in the database, which authentication is used, etc. I didn't do it all half-hearted of course. On top of that, I was told to use Hapi; a backend framework I had never heard of. Which I didn't complain, even now. I did what was asked of me and I tried my best to implement with best practices and clean implementation. Every design was approved by my higher up, which is directly the CTO himself.
