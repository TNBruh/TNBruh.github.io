#### The program intermittently encrypts a file; it means that the program doesnâ€™t encrypt the entire file but partially within a certain number of hop; or the first or latter half of the file, depending on the settings.

This is actually one of the malwares I made. Its a multi-threaded ransomware that can technically uniquely identify a victim as well and does so without the need of internet. I don't immediately write this as "ransomware" in my portfolio because people are too easily scared when they're around "bad things".

As for how this works, the basics aren't complicated. But the evasion is. There's 1 thread that does the house-keeping and the rest does the encrypting. The "general thread" generates a unique symmetrical encryption key and creates other threads; afterwards, it distributes the key to them and start scouring for files to encrypt. Then it creates a file that's required for decryption; in it, contains the symmetrical encryption key encrypted by the operator's public key of choice. The rest of the threads encrypt files with said symmetrical encryption key.
