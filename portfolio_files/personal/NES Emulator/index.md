#### Building an Emulator for the NES using Rust to Get to Know Better on Low-Level Programming and as a Recreational Programming. Using multitude of references such as https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/6502_Assembly

Yes, I do recreational programming more often than I thought. This one was to also get to know better about how emulations work. I've always thought that one needs to translate each instruction so that it can be read by the current CPU; turns out, my assumption wasn't too far.

I followed [this guide](https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook/) and deviated from it a little bit for three reasons:

1. To prove myself that I actually know what I'm doing
2. Adding my own touch
3. To learn

I'm taking my time as I'm getting busy and losing my free time. Slowly but surely, I want to finish this... Oh- and it's built with Rust.
