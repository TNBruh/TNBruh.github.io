#### Demonstrates watershed algorithm to find the lowest point/node of an area.

Another one of my recovered university tasks. I forgot what the subject was. As the name suggests, we had to implement the watershed algorithm. Said algorithm is used to find the lowest point of an area. I decided to use C# because I wanted to get used to it for making games in Unity.
