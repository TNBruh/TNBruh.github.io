#### An app for users to read Lovecraftâ€™s various works and biography. Made a scraper to get the data needed as well.

One of the few university tasks that I can recall making and recover. I beleieve, the subject was Android Programming. It's not a true archive since there are still some works that are not in the public domain. I scraped the data from [this site](https://www.hplovecraft.com/). With Selenium and Python, I built a scraper just for that site. Then did a bit of preprocessing. Finally the scraped data is useable for the Flutter components I'm using.
