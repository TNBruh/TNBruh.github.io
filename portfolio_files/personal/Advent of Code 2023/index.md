#### Briefly participated in Advent of Code 2023 event using Go for recalling the syntax of the language and how it works.

I wanted to revisit Go for a bit and I thought there are always 3 best way to re-warm up to a language.

1. Solve puzzles
2. Implement an algorithm
3. Make something

Usually, my go-to is either 2 or 3. Since it was christmas, I thought that it was time to try out the Advent of Code.

Something about it feels much more engaging than the puzzles given on LeetCode and the like. It feels hand-made, not based on some sort of template. Although I barely touched LeetCode. One day I will either revisit this or jump to the latest available Advent of Code.
