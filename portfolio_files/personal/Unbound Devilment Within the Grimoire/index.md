#### A game made for thesis (skripsi) as a condition to graduate from University. The resulting game is made based off of Unityâ€™s experimental DOTS libraries which aims to compete with the classical architecture in terms of performance.

The games (yes, plural) themselves each only took 2 weeks; but don't get me wrong, it was still thousands of lines of code. I had to scour for documentations that didn't even exist and partially rely on reading the descriptions given by the auto-correct. One thing's for sure, building it was fun. I had hands-on with the Entity Component System approach and brainstormed in such a way that I didn't expect.

The games are bullet hells, something like Touhou. They consist of three "spell cards" or "waves" with one boss. You are intentionally given unlimited lives. One version of the game is made with the classic unity approach with OOP and the other version is made with Hybrid DOTS.

I measured the performance different. In memory and speed. The result was kind of expected. OOP Unity was still better than Hybrid DOTS. I took an assumption it's because Hybrid DOTS was still **experimental**. It's crazy, I wish Unity can get it done fast. But it is what it is.
